Poker Push/Fold Memory Game:

If you play enough poker tournaments, you will find yourself in a “short-stack” situation where your tournament life is on the line. In these situations, the most profitable way to play is to use the Push/Fold system. Simply put, if you have a good hand before the flop (any community cards come out) you put all your chips in for a chance to double up - if you lose the hand you're out of the tournament.

Poker pros memorize charts that tell them what they should do when put in a Push/Fold situation. This game will help you test your memorization of these charts by presenting you with a random poker hand and giving you the chance to push or fold your stack. If you get 10 hands in a row correct you will gain poker pro status and win the tournament! If you get even 1 hand wrong you’ll lose the game and gently be directed to the charts for a little more study.
