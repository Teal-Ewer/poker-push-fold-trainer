Poker Push/Fold Trainer (Memory Game):

If you play enough poker tournaments, you will find yourself in a “short-stack” situation where your tournament life is on the line. In these situations, the most profitable way to play is to use the “Push/Fold” system. Simply put, if you have a good hand before the flop (any community cards come out) you put all your chips in for a chance to double up - if you lose the hand you are out of the tournament.

Poker pros memorize charts that tell them what they should do when put in this scenario. This game will help you test your memorization of these charts by presenting you with a random poker hand and giving you the chance to push or fold your stack. If you get 5 hands right you will gain poker pro status and win the tournament! If you get 5 hands wrong you’ll lose the game and be directed to the charts to study more.
